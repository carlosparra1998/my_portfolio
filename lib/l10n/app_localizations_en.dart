      'I was born in the city of Albacete, where I obtained my degree in Computer Engineering at the University of Castilla-La Mancha in 2022. There I was awarded with the prize for the most innovative Final Degree Project by the Campollano Foundation (2022). \n\nProfessional in front-end development since 2020, specialized in Flutter and the Android/iOS ecosystem. I have extensive experience using programming languages such as Dart and Kotlin, and I consistently apply Clean Code principles and scalable architectures like MVVM and Clean Architecture. I also master different levels of testing in Flutter, including unit, widget, and integration tests, ensuring the quality and stability of the applications I build. In my day-to-day role as a senior front-end developer, I design and develop high-performance mobile and web applications, using state management solutions such as Provider, BLoC, and Cubit, as well as other advanced practices in modern Flutter development. I have also contributed to the open-source ecosystem by developing packages published on pub.dev. In addition to my work as a front-end developer, I am the founder and organizer of Flutter Murcia, a local community created to share knowledge and connect developers in the region who are interested in Flutter. I have participated as a speaker in events such as #FlutterInProductionExtended by Flutter Málaga, and in the workshop “Learn to Use Flutter and Build Cross-Platform Apps,” organized by CEEIM and MurciaDev.';
