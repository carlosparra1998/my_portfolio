  "description" : "I was born in the city of Albacete, where I obtained my degree in Computer Engineering at the University of Castilla-La Mancha in 2022. There I was awarded with the prize for the most innovative Final Degree Project by the Campollano Foundation (2022). \n\nI am currently a senior frontend developer at Entelgy. In my daily work I focus mainly on the design and development of a web application for a potential client using the Flutter framework. It includes the integral development of the business logic and the different user interfaces applying responsive design techniques. For the API communication, DIO is used to properly manage the middleware. Implementation of a clean architecture with MVVM, applying Clean Code principles to ensure scalable, maintainable and modular code. State and reactivity management using Provider. This project works in an Agile (Scrum) environment, using JIRA for project management. Use of GitFlow on GitHub for version control.",
